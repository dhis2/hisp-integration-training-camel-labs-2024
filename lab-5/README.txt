In this final lab, you will monitor the Camel route you developed from the Hawtio console.

Instructions:

1. Copy the contents of the previous lab (i.e., lab-4) to this directory (i.e., lab-5).
2. Open a terminal where the current directory is lab-5
3. From the terminal, run the Camel route you developed with JBang Camel.
4. From a NEW terminal, launch Hawtio console AND attach the JVM agent to your running Camel route like so: "camel hawtio cheese". Note: "cheese" is the name of the route.
5. Your browser should automatically open a new tab after running the command in step 4. However, if this does not happen, open the Hawtio console from your browser: "http://localhost:8888/hawtio/connect/remote".
6. Connect Hawtio to the agent by clicking on "Connect".
7. Navigate and explore the Camel routes shown in Hawtio.
